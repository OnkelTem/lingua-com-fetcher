# 1.0.0-rc.0

Turned it into a CLI-tool, installable via `npm`.

It provides two commands: `ls` - for listing available langauges and `fetch` - for fetching lessons.

It now reads credentials from a file named `lingua-com-secret.json` located in the current directory, but can be overriden with `--secret|-s` option.

Logging-in is not necessary, the script can function anonymously. However it will only download what is available. There is no much difference between anon and non-premium authenticated user. You still get most if you use a premium account.
