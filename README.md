# Lingua.com lessons fetcher

This repository contains a [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) script that
fetches lessons from the https://lingua.com/ website.

Specifically, it downloads:

1. Lesson texts
2. Lesson audio files
3. Lesson PDFs (with exercises)

## Lessons Access

This script can function in 3 modes:

- anonymous
- free (signed in)
- premium (signed in)

I didn't see any difference between anonymous and free content. Both can access the same limited set of lessons and almost without audio. With [premium](https://lingua.com/premium/) access, you can download everything.

## Install

```
$ npm i -g lingua-com-fetcher
```

To update to the latest version:

```
$ npm i -g lingua-com-fetcher@latest
```

## Usage

List available languages:

```
$ lingua-com-fetcher ls

Download lessons for a language:

For example, to fetch lessons for the Spanish language into `outdir` directory:

```

## Providing Credentials

If you create a file called **lingua-com-secret.json**, it will be used to log you in:

```json
{
  "username": "Your-Lingua-Com-Username",
  "password": "Your-Lingua-Com-Password"
}
```

If placed in the current directory, it will be read automatically. You can also provide its path via the `--secret` option:

```
$ lingua-com-fetcher --secret path/to/your/secret.json fetch businessenglish outdir
```
